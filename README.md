# STL Cheatsheet

This repository contains examples and explanations of various C++ STL components.

## Overview
This repository contains practical examples and explanations of various **C++ Standard Template Library (STL)** components.  
It’s designed for learners who want to explore STL with clean, commented code snippets.

## Currently Included

- **Vectors**: Dynamic arrays with useful member functions and iterators.  
  
- **Lists** : Doubly linked lists that allow fast insertion and deletion from both      ends.  
  Unlike vectors, lists do not provide random access, but iterators remain valid even after insertion or deletion.

  - **Deques**  : Double-ended queues that allow fast insertion and deletion from both the front and the back.
  They provide random access to elements (like vectors) but manage storage in multiple dynamically allocated blocks, making middle insertions less efficient.

  - **Pairs**  : A pair is a simple conatiner from C++ Standard Template Library
  that holds two elements possibly of different data types.
  
  - **Stacks**  : Stack is a linear data structure which follow Last In, First Out (LIFO) Principle which means the element inserted at last will be removed first

  (More STL components will be added gradually.)

## Upcoming STL Components

- **Queues**  
- **Priority Queues**  
- **Maps & Multimaps**  
- **Unordered Maps**  
- **Sets**

Stay tuned as more examples will be added soon!
